**Introduction**

In the rapidly evolving field of wireless communication, managing network congestion remains a critical challenge. Congestion in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can lead to significant delays and data loss, undermining the efficiency of these systems. To address this, our project aims to develop an intelligent framework leveraging deep learning techniques for effective congestion control in WSNs.

**Research Importance**

This framework is crucial for enhancing data flow and minimizing delays caused by network congestion. Recent studies, such as those by Rathore et al. (2021) and Chen et al. (2022), underscore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in optimizing communication networks. However, there is a notable gap in applying advanced AI-driven congestion control strategies specifically within WSNs. By focusing on this niche, our research seeks to bridge this gap, offering innovative methodologies that could significantly improve the performance and reliability of WSNs.
